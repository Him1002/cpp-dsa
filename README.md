#  C++ DSA Practice 

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice problems implemented in **C++**.  
I’m using this repo to track progress, experiment with approaches, and build a strong foundation in problem-solving.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- Source codes are written in **C++**.  
- Organized by topic as the repo grows.  
- Uses **VS Code tasks** for compilation & execution.  

## ⚙️ Setup & Run

### 1️  Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Him1002/cpp-dsa.git
cd cpp-dsa

2️ Open in VS Code (or File → Open Folder).
3️ Create input.txt and output.txt in the repo root:

input.txt → add your test input here

output.txt → program output will be written here after each run

4️ Run C++ files using VS Code Tasks:

Press Ctrl + Shift + B to compile and run the currently open file.

The executable is temporary and deleted automatically after each run → no clutter.

⚙️ VS Code Task Configuration

This repo already includes a preconfigured .vscode/tasks.json.

No manual setup needed.

Compiles the active .cpp file.

Redirects input/output via input.txt and output.txt in the root.

Deletes the .exe after execution.
