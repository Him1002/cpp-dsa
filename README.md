This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice problems implemented in **C++**.  
I’m using this repo to track progress, experiment with approaches, and build a strong foundation in problem-solving.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- Source codes are written in **C++**.  
- Organized by topic as the repo grows.  
- Uses **VS Code tasks** for compilation & execution. 

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized to maintain clarity as it grows. The core logic is powered by a custom VS Code task runner for a seamless coding experience.

```text
.
├── .vscode/
│   └── tasks.json
├── topic_name/
│   └── problem.cpp
├── input.txt
└── output.txt
```

-   **Source Codes:** All implementations are in C++.
-   **Organization:** Problems are sorted into folders based on DSA topics.
-   **Automation:** Uses **VS Code tasks** for a one-command compile & run workflow.

## ⚙️ Setup & Run

### 1️.  Clone the repo:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Him1002/cpp-dsa.git
    cd cpp-dsa
```

**2️. Open in VS Code (or File → Open Folder).**

### 3️. Create input.txt and output.txt in the repo root:
-   input.txt → add your test input here

-   output.txt → program output will be written here after each run

### 4️. Run C++ files using VS Code Tasks:

-   Press Ctrl + Shift + B to compile and run the currently open file.

-   The executable is temporary and deleted automatically after each run → no clutter.

## ⚙️ VS Code Task Configuration

-   This repo already includes a preconfigured .vscode/tasks.json.

-   No manual setup needed.

-   Compiles the active .cpp file.

-   Redirects input/output via input.txt and output.txt in the root.

-   Deletes the .exe after execution.

## 🛠 Tools & Environment
